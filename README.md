## About shiny-meetings

`shiny-meetings` is a social and collaborative shiny app development
project, inspired by the `TidyTuesday` project. Following is the general
workflow:

- Propose a 15-day shiny app project
  [here](https://github.com/durraniu/shiny-meetings/discussions/3)  
- Choose a [TidyTuesday
  dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) if it is a
  data-driven project  
- First 2 days:
  - Brainstorm on the features and do initial wireframing. You may use
    AI tools such as [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/), [shiny
    assistant](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/assistant/#) or [ploomber AI
    editor](https://editor.ploomber.io/)  
  - Choose the framework to use: Just shiny, golem, rhino, shiny +
    plumber, shiny + ambiorix + htmx, etc.  
- First meeting to discuss the features and UI  
- Next 5 days: Develop the app. Each participant chooses the stuff to
  work on solo or in a pair. This can be work on theming, layout,
  functions, modules, APIs, database, etc.  
- Next 5 days: Move to a different aspect of development, e.g., if
  previously working on UI, now work on server  
- Collaborate mostly on GitHub. Depending on the type of work, you can
  also do pair-programming e.g., with liveshare in VSCode, etc.  
- Second meeting to discuss the deployment and any development related
  stuff  
- Final 5 days: Deploy. This will likely involve using containers and
  scaling them. golem and rhino will be helpful. Also, faucet.

Projects start on Wednesdays with meetings on Fridays. We meet via Zoom
(links are provided in the DSLC [slack channel](#0)). If youâ€™re not a
